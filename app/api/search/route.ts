 * field-by-field notes on mapHotel() below for exactly what's real LiteAPI
 * data vs. derived vs. simply unavailable at this level.
 *
 * Takes the same query params the results URL carries, parsed and validated
 * by the one shared codec in lib/search-params.ts, so a malformed link fails
 * here the same way it fails in the page rather than reaching LiteAPI.
 *
 * Returns the FULL available result set in one response, not a page of it —
 * see the pagination note above searchHotelRates() in lib/liteapi.ts for the
 * measured reasons limit/offset can't back a "See more". `total` is
 * therefore a real total, and the page slices it 10 at a time.
