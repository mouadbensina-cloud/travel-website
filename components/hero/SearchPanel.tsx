/**
 * The leftmost field, unified across both states: "Where" / "Search
 * destinations" IS "Plan your trip" / the AI prompt — same slot, same text
 * style, just a crossfade between two labels and two value elements stacked
 * in place. Splitting label and value into their own small stacks (rather
 * than swapping the whole field as one block) is what makes the text read as
 * morphing in place instead of the old block sliding out from underneath.
 *
 * The manual-mode value is a real text input now (not a static button) so a
 * destination can be typed — clicking or focusing it opens WhereDropdown the
 * same way TripField's onClick opens When/Who. The selected-state pill
 * itself isn't painted here — it's SearchPanel's shared sliding
 * `activePillStyle` overlay (Figma 33214:32488 hover, 33211:30523
 * selected) — this div only owns the hover treatment and reports its own
 * rect via `fieldRef` for that overlay to measure. `active` exists purely
 * to turn that hover treatment off while selected: the overlay paints
 * *behind* this div (so When/Who's own text stays on top of it — see
 * SearchPanel), which means this div's own hover:bg-surface would
 * otherwise still paint over the white selected pill on rollover.
 *
 * `collapsed` swaps the empty-state copy and its color (Figma 33325:31409):
 * the sticky compact bar reads "Edit destinations" in the same dark
 * `#0d121c` the applied value uses, rather than the tall bar's lighter,
 * grey "Search destinations" — since at that point the framing is "edit
 * your current search," not "start one." It's the discrete `collapsed`
 * boolean, not the continuous --collapse-p the bar's own geometry animates
 * on: this codebase already treats state-driven copy swaps as a triggered
 * change (see useHeroCollapse's own doc comment), only visual dimensions
 * interpolate continuously.

/**
 * When/Who shrink away into this on AI activation. It carries its own
 * flex-grow (2 — matching When + Who's original 1 + 1 share) rather than
 * being sized from its content, for two reasons at once:
 *
 * 1. Keeps Where/PrimaryField at its original ~1.7-of-3.7 share instead of
 *    grabbing every pixel this group isn't using — that greedy-PrimaryField
 *    version was what squeezed this group below its content's width and
 *    truncated "Add guests".
 * 2. Because the group's own width is now a real flex-resolved number
 *    (not shrink-to-fit), the flex-grow split between When and Who *inside*
 *    it has actual leftover space to divide — which is the condition that
 *    flex-grow + flex-basis:0 needs to behave predictably at all. (An
 *    earlier version measured this group's width with
 *    `getBoundingClientRect` instead; that raced the "Circular Std" web
 *    font swap and could grab a too-narrow number on a cold load.)
 *
 * flex-grow transitioning 2 -> 0 is what produces the "widen into the freed
 * space" effect: as this group's share shrinks, the sibling's constant 1.7
 * share simply becomes a bigger fraction of the row.
